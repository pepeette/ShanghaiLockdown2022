# ShanghaiLockdown2022

Our very "privileged" compound WeChat group, typically muted, awakened to the Shanghai lockdown on March 15th. Residents began to openly challenge the lockdown, question the numbers, and scrutinize the news.

2. The illusion of central information that is shared, monitored, and censored.
3. The vocabulary used in Chinese that belongs to the lexical field of war.

More analysis will follow once I am out of the country.
