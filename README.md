# ShanghaiLockdown2022
Our very "privileged" compound wechat group that is usually muted... woke up to the Shanghai lockdown in march 15th.... and people started to talk... residents started to openly challenge the lockdown... challenge the numbers... challenge the news.... A government representative lady got invited to monitor / announce gov measure... she got called out and shut down after 10 days... This analysis intends to showcase  1. the open talks of privileged chinese residents on a tool famously censored by the government  2. the illusion of central information shared, monitored and censored  3. the vocabulary used in Chinese that belongs to war lexical field... More to be analysed when out of the country
