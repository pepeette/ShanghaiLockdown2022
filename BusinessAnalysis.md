If this compound was a company, there would be a few areas that any consulting company would list to address....

<br/>


⏩  *Situation :*
our community individuals are expressing distressing emotions, stress, physical exhaustion, psychological overwhelm and even strong cynicism for some. 
> Those are **symptoms of burn out.**
<br/>

⏩  *Problem :*
when the company sees a rise of burnout employees, what should they do?
. Focus on individual care, focusing on saying that it is employee weakness?
. Or rather assessing these same workplace policies that contribute to the burn out?

> Studies show that **addressing the latter (work environment) is what drives a lasting positive change** in a company. 
<br/> 
 
⏩  *Implication :*
"If work environment factors are a major reason why people experience burnout, 
then why aren’t we seeing more work-related interventions?" says the research.

Instead, we are witnessing plethore **individual initiatives** to group buy food, 
some neighbours sharing mental health support tips, 
others calling out our "head of communication" <br/>
**to compensate the lack of goal oriented + process driven clarity** that communities need to gather.

<br/>

⏩  *Needs pay off :*
Rather than focusing all our attention on putting out individual fires, 
we should **start paying attention to larger factors contributing to these flare-ups** 
and study the variables that people need to develop community behaviour change : 
> empathy -> trust -> belonging -> behaviour alignment.
<br/>

⏩  *Proposals :*
This could start with preventive actions that build trust and empathy from our main characters : <br/>
* Management procedures re evaluation, such as tasks, efforts all need to be related to the goal, agreed with the comunity. It is a social pact. <br/>
* Our "contracted head of communications" she could also review what are her OKR (obj & key results)... 
Her comms have been almost inexistant, as i previously showed analyzing over 9000 messages on this chat with basic data analysis, 
she shared less than 60 msg even though residents were calling out (@mentionning her name).

And first and foremost, **addressing what goal does this community strive for**, to shape all related actions subsequently. <br/>
* Do we want more food / more cheese ?
* Do we aim at being able to walk  within the compound ?
* Do we all stick together towards early release within area ？
* Which scenario seem plausible in the short term, and in a longer term ? 

> Bref, **what do sign for ?** in the light of central policies.
<br/>

We are currently at breach of our social pact between leaders and commumity.
