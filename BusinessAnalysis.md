If this compound was a company, there would be a few areas that any consulting company would list to address....

<br/>


⏩  *Situation :*
our community individuals are expressing distressing emotions, stress, physical exhaustion, psychological overwhelm and even strong cynicism for some. 
> Those are **symptoms of burn out.**
<br/>

⏩  *Problem :*
when the company sees a rise of burnout employees, what should they do?
. Focus on individual care, focusing on saying that it is employee weakness?
. Or rather assessing these same workplace policies that contribute to the burn out?

> Studies show that **addressing the latter (work environment) is what drives a lasting positive change** in a company. 
<br/> 
 
⏩  *Implication :*
"If work environment factors are a major reason why people experience burnout, 
then why aren’t we seeing more work-related interventions?" says the research.

Instead, we are witnessing plethore **individual initiatives** to group buy food, 
Monica sharing mental health support, 
Rong calling our "head of communication" 
**to compensate the lack of goal oriented + process driven clarity** that communities need to gather.
<br/>

⏩  *Needs pay off :*
Rather than focusing all our attention on putting out individual fires, 
we should **start paying attention to larger factors contributing to these flare-ups** 
and study the variables that people need to develop community behaviour change : 
> empathy -> trust -> belonging -> behaviour alignment.
<br/>

⏩  *Proposals :*
This could start with preventive actions that build trust and empathy from our main characters :
. Management procedures re evaluation, such as tasks, efforts all need to be related to the goal, agreed with the comunity. It is a social pact.
. Our "contracted head of comms", being inexistant, as i previously shown analyzing the 340 average messages per day on this chat with basic data analysis, 
speaking less than 60 msg over abundant people at mentionning her (100 times), should also be sacked for non performance.

And first and foremost, **addressing what goal does this community strive for**, to shape all related actions subsequently.
. Do we want more food / more cheese ?
. Do we aim at being able to walk  within the compound ?
. Do we all stick together towards early release within area ？
. Which scenario seem plausible in the short term, and in a longer term ?

> Bref, **what do sign for ?**
<br/>

We are currently at breach of our social pact between leaders and commumity.
